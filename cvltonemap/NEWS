Version 0.2.2:
- This version uses much less graphics memory than older versions. This allows
  to use this program on older hardware and/or to tonemap much larger images.
  In addition, it is now possible to select 16 bit or 32 bit precision for 
  tonemapping. 16 bit is the new default: it requires half as much graphics
  memory and is usually sufficient.
- Common HDR image formats such as RGBE, EXR, TIFF, PFM, DCRAW can now be
  opened directly in CVLTonemap if the pfstools package is installed.
- Fixed build problems.
