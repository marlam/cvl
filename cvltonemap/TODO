- The simplistic GUI currently is neither userfriendly nor very useful.
  It needs to be rewritten.

- The parameter selector should have a "reset to default" button.
- It should be documented that the parameters in the bottom half are
  for postprocessing and applied after tonemapping.
- Add basic preprocessing filters: linear/gamma/log mapping with min/max
  clamping. This can replace the "maximum luminance" parameter of some
  tonemapping methods, which already effectively did a linear scaling.
