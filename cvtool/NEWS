Version 0.0.3 (not yet released):
- New and improved cvtool commands:
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New function cvl_getopt() for command line handling, including some useful
    option types.
  - Fixed cvl_convole() and cvl_convolve3d(): the order of the dim_x, dim_y, 
    and dim_t arguments was changed.
  - New macro cvl_assert() and new function cvl_print_backtrace(). Both are 
    useful for debugging purposes.
  - New convenience functions cvl_field_get(i|f)*() for fields that store 
    only floats or ints.
- Removed:
- Miscellaneous:
  - cvtool: Added a crash handler that prints a backtrace on SIGILL, 
    SIGFPE, and SIGSEGV, at least on platforms where this is supported.

Version 0.0.2:
- New and improved cvtool commands:
  - sedt:
    Compute the Squared Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT) in two or three 
    dimensions.
  - layer:
    Mix multiple sources by layering them on top of each other and combining
    them in one of several modes.
  - draw:
    Draw lines, curves, geometric objects, and text. This command is a frontend
    to the CAIRO graphics library.
  - filter:
    This new command replaces the old smooth command. It also support the 
    min and max filters, allowing erosion/dilation and opening/closing.
  - channel:
    Extract color channels as graylevel, and allow to reconvert a graylevel
    image to a color channel.
  - All commands that take colors as arguments:
    Colors can now be specified as r<val>g<val>b<val> instead of the old
    rrr,ggg,bbb format. For example, "255,127,0" is now "r255g127b0" or shorter
    "r255g127".
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New functions cvl_sedt() and cvl_sedt3d() to compute the Squared Euclidean 
    Distance Transform (SEDT).
  - New function cvl_frame_layer() to mix multiple sources.
  - New function cvl_sort_array_pixel() to sort an array of pixels.
  - New functions cvl_cairo_start() and cvl_cairo_stop() provide an interface
    to the CAIRO graphics library.
  - New functions cvl_load_pnm() and cvl_save_pnm() to easily load and save
    NetPBM files.
  - New min and max filters.
  - Renamed many cvl_frame_* functions to cvl_*.
  - Renamed cvl_frame_smooth_*() to cvl_filter_*().
- Removed:
  - CVL: removed the cvl_draw_* functions. They are obsoleted by the new CAIRO
    graphics library interface.
  - cvtool: removed the grid command.
- Bug fixes and improvements:
  All over the place.
