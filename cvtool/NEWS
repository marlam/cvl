Version 0.0.4 (not yet released):
- New and improved cvtool commands:
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New function cvl_field_array() to access the raw array data of a field.
- Removed:
- Miscellaneous:

Version 0.0.3:
- New and improved cvtool commands:
  - mat:
    Compute the Medial Axis Transform (MAT) of an object in two or three 
    dimensions.
  - skeleton:
    Compute the skeleton of an object in two or three dimensions.
  - fieldconv:
    Converts between fields (integer or float data) and frames.
  - diff:
    Can now print simple statistics.
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New functions cvl_mat() and cvl_mat3d() to compute Medial Axis Transforms 
    (MATs).
  - New functions cvl_skeleton() and cvl_skeleton3d() to compute skeletons.
  - New function cvl_diffstat() to compute simple statistics for the differences
    between two frames.
  - New function cvl_sort_array_float().
  - New function cvl_iroundf() to round floats.
  - New function cvl_getopt() for command line handling, including some useful
    option types.
  - New functions cvl_gcd() and cvl_lcm() to compute the Greatest Common Divisor
    and the Least Common Multiple.
  - New functinos cvl_wrap() and cvl_clamp() for wrapped and clamped indexing.
  - New macro cvl_assert() and new function cvl_print_backtrace(). Both are 
    useful for debugging purposes.
  - Simplified the handling of fields, especially the input/output:
    - New convenience functions cvl_field_(i|f)_new() and cvl_field_(i|f)_get*()
      for fields that store only floats or ints.
    - Reworked cvl_field_read*(), cvl_field_write*().
    - Fields are now always read and written in machine dependant raw format.
      This simplifies and speeds up things, but field data is not guaranteed to
      be interchangeable between different platforms anymore.
  - Simplified cvl_io_eof().
  - Switched vector functions from double to float.
  - Switched color functions from double to float.
  - Fixed cvl_convole() and cvl_convolve3d(): the order of the dim_x, dim_y, 
    and dim_t arguments was changed.
  - Fixed cvl_sedt(): black is background and everything else is 
    foreground, not vice-versa!
- Removed:
  - Field input/output functions cvl_field_*_raw(). They are obsoleted by the
    new cvl_field_read*() and cvl_field_write() functions.
  - Field input/output helper cvl_field_stream_eof(). Use the simplified 
    cvl_io_eof() instead.
  - Field access functions cvl_field_ref*(). They were ugly.
- Miscellaneous:
  - cvtool: Added a crash handler that prints a backtrace on SIGILL, 
    SIGFPE, and SIGSEGV, at least on platforms where this is supported.
  - Bugfixes all over the place.

Version 0.0.2:
- New and improved cvtool commands:
  - sedt:
    Compute the Squared Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT) in two or three 
    dimensions.
  - layer:
    Mix multiple sources by layering them on top of each other and combining
    them in one of several modes.
  - draw:
    Draw lines, curves, geometric objects, and text. This command is a frontend
    to the CAIRO graphics library.
  - filter:
    This new command replaces the old smooth command. It also support the 
    min and max filters, allowing erosion/dilation and opening/closing.
  - channel:
    Extract color channels as graylevel, and allow to reconvert a graylevel
    image to a color channel.
  - All commands that take colors as arguments:
    Colors can now be specified as r<val>g<val>b<val> instead of the old
    rrr,ggg,bbb format. For example, "255,127,0" is now "r255g127b0" or shorter
    "r255g127".
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New functions cvl_sedt() and cvl_sedt3d() to compute the Squared Euclidean 
    Distance Transform (SEDT).
  - New function cvl_frame_layer() to mix multiple sources.
  - New function cvl_sort_array_pixel() to sort an array of pixels.
  - New functions cvl_cairo_start() and cvl_cairo_stop() provide an interface
    to the CAIRO graphics library.
  - New functions cvl_load_pnm() and cvl_save_pnm() to easily load and save
    NetPBM files.
  - New min and max filters.
  - Renamed many cvl_frame_* functions to cvl_*.
  - Renamed cvl_frame_smooth_*() to cvl_filter_*().
- Removed:
  - CVL: removed the cvl_draw_* functions. They are obsoleted by the new CAIRO
    graphics library interface.
  - cvtool: removed the grid command.
- Bug fixes and improvements:
  All over the place.
