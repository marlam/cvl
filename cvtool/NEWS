Version 0.0.2:
- New and improved cvtool commands:
  - edt:
    Compute the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) in two or three dimensions.
  - layer:
    Mix multiple sources by layering them on top of each other and combining
    them in one of several modes.
  - draw:
    Draw lines, curves, geometric objects, and text. This command is a frontend
    to the CAIRO graphics library.
  - filter:
    This new command replaces the old smooth command. It also support the 
    min and max filters, allowing erosion/dilation and opening/closing.
  - channel:
    Extract color channels as graylevel, and allow to reconvert a graylevel
    image to a color channel.
  - All commands that take colors as arguments:
    Colors can now be specified as r<val>g<val>b<val> instead of the old
    rrr,ggg,bbb format. For example, "255,127,0" is now "r255g127b0" or shorter
    "r255g127".
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New functions cvl_edt() and cvl_edt3d() to compute the Euclidean Distance 
    Transform (EDT).
  - New function cvl_frame_layer() to mix multiple sources.
  - New function cvl_sort_array_pixel() to sort an array of pixels.
  - New functions cvl_cairo_start() and cvl_cairo_stop() provide an interface
    to the CAIRO graphics library.
  - New functions cvl_load_pnm() and cvl_save_pnm() to easily load and save
    NetPBM files.
  - New min and max filters.
  - Renamed many cvl_frame_* functions to cvl_*.
  - Renamed cvl_frame_smooth_*() to cvl_filter_*().
- Removed:
  - CVL: removed the cvl_draw_* functions. They are obsoleted by the new CAIRO
    graphics library interface.
  - cvtool: removed the grid command.
- Bug fixes and improvements:
  All over the place.

Version 0.0.1:
