Version 0.1.0:
- cvtool: Added the wallis subcommand to the filter command.
- CVL: Aded cvl_filter_wallis() and cvl_filter3d_wallis().
- Add "extern inline" functions to the corresponding .c files so that the
  symbols are always in the library.
- CVL, cvtool: Renamed "average" to "mean" where appropriate.
- Removed the notgnulib module c99math, because the functions fmin, fmax, and 
  lround are now used in the public header file cvl_math.h, which cannot include
  c99math.h. If these functions are still missing on a relevant platform, I'll
  look into this again.
- CVL: Reorganization:
  - Move inline functions to header files (with "extern inline").
  - Remove cvl.c, and compile the modules one by one, as it should be.
- CVL: remove cvl.pc (pkg-config file) and the cvl-config.script. Provide
  a new cvl.m4 file with a AM_LIBCVL macro that is based on
  AC_LIB_HAVE_LINKFLAGS.
- Improvements for the build system:
  - Quote arguments of M4 macros.
  - Use AC_LIB_HAVE_LINKFLAGS to detect libraries. Do not use *-config scripts
    or pkg-config. This avoids problems that are reported in this thread:
    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/
    1610/focus=1610 .
- CVL: Various cleanups, minor fixes, and additional cvl_assert() calls.
- CVL: Fix for cvl_skeleton3d(), memory savings for cvl_skeleton() and 
  cvl_skeleton3d().
- CVL: Add functions cvl_field_array() and cvl_field_const_array() to access 
  the raw array data of a field.
- Minor documentation improvements.

Version 0.0.3:
- Gnulib update.
- CVL: Remove cvl_field_ref*() functions.
- CVL: Switched optical flow functions from double to float.
- CVL: Switched color functions from double to float.
- CVL: Switched vector functions from double to float.
- CVL: Switched the cvl_edge_* functions to use floats instead of doubles.
- CVL: Added cvl_iroundf() to round floats.
- CVL: Simplify cvl_io_eof(). Remove obsoleted cvl_field_stream_eof().
- cvtool: Added a mat command as an interface to cvl_mat() and cvl_mat3d().
- CVL: Added cvl_mat() and cvl_mat3d() to compute the Medial Axis Transform 
  (MAT).
- cvtool: Added a skeleton command as an interface to cvl_skeleton() and 
  cvl_skeleton3d().
- CVL: Added cvl_skeleton() and cvl_skeleton3d() to compute skeletons.
- cvtool: Added a fieldconv command that converts between fields and frames.
- CVL: Added cvl_wrap() and cvl_clamp() for wrapped and clamped indexing.
- CVL: Fixed cvl_reflect(): avoid arithmetic overflow if bound > INT_MAX / 2.
- CVL: Fixed cvl_sedt(): black is background and everything else is foreground,
  not vice-versa!
- CVL: Add functions cvl_gcd() and cvl_lcm() to compute the Greatest Common
  Divisor and the Least Common Multiple.
- Documentation: Minor improvements.
- Documentation: Updated doc/cvtool-example-nasa-script.sh.
- CVL: Simplified the handling of fields, especially the input/output.
- Gnulib update.
- Autoconf update: build-aux/c.m4 is not needed anymore.
- cvtool: Enhanced diff command. It can now use cvl_diffstat() and print the
  resulting statistics.
- CVL: Added new function cvl_diffstat() to compute simple statistics for the 
  differences between two frames.
- CVL: Add cvl_sort_array_float()
- CVL: Add missing const qualifier to prototype of cvl_field_write_raw().
- CVL: cvl_getopt(): Added the new option type CVL_OPTION_INFO for options that
  request information, like --help and --version.
- cvtool: Improve crash messages.
- cvtool: Adjust --version and --help output to more closely match the latest 
  GNU standards.
- CVL: Export command line handling function cvl_getopt() and support data 
  types. This code was in cvtool before, but is now accessible for other 
  programs.
- CVL: Fix cvl_convole() and cvl_convolve3d(): the order of dim_x, dim_y, and 
  dim_t was changed.
- cvtool: Added a crash handler to cvtool. It prints a backtrace on SIGILL, 
  SIGFPE, and SIGSEGV. The crash handler is only available for systems with 
  POSIX signals. A backtrace is only printed on GNU/Linux systems.
- CVL: Export cvl_assert() and cvl_print_backtrace().
- CVL: Added convenience funtions cvl_field_get(i|f)*() for fields that store 
  only floats or ints.

Version 0.0.2:
- Gnulib update.
- In cvl/Makefile.am and cvtool/Makefile.am: use $(top_builddir) where
  appropriate.
- Replace '#ifdef _WIN32' with '#ifdef W32_NATIVE', where W32_NATIVE is defined
  in config.h if the following is true:
  '#if (defined _WIN32 || defined __WIN32__) && !defined __CYGWIN__'.
  The reason is that Cygwin defines _WIN32 nowadays, but we want the UNIX API
  on that platform.
- CVL: Improve error messages when reading NetPBM frames.
- CVL: Export CVL_VERSION, needed by cvl.m4.
- CVL: Renamed many cvl_frame_* functions to cvl_*.
- cvtool: Added the sedt command as an interface to cvl_sedt() and cvl_sedt3d().
- CVL: Added cvl_sedt() and cvl_sedt3d() to compute the Squared Euclidean 
  Distance Transform in O(n).
- CVL: Fixed prototype of functions that get an array of frames.
- CVL: Added functions to report the size of fields and frames.
- CVL: Print a backtrace when cvl_assert() fails (only on glibc systems).
- CVL/cvtool: Added xadd and xsub layering modes.
- CVL/cvtool: Added min and max filters.
- CVL/cvtool: Renamed *smooth* to *filter*.
- cvtool: Improved int/double array option handling.
- cvtool: Added a layer command.
- CVL: Added cvl_frame_layer().
- cvtool: Changed channel command: extract as graylevel, and allow reversion.
- CVL: cvl_io_(load|save)_pnm(): close file.
- CVL: Add function cvl_sort_array_pixel().
- CVL: Change prototype of cvl_pixel_convert().
- CVL: Export cvl_frame_set_pixel_type()
- CVL: Remove cvl_frame_rgb_to_?() functions
- cvtool/CVL: Minor documentation improvements.
- CVL: Remove cvl_draw_* functions.
- cvtool: Removed grid command.

  text. The command is a frontend to the CAIRO library.
- Added string_to_utf8() module to notgnulib.
- Gnulib update. Added the following modules:
  xstrndup, localcharset, iconvme.
- CVL: cvl_color_from_string()
  cvtool: All commands that accept color names as options
  Replace rrr,ggg,bbb format with r<val>g<val>b<val>.
- CVL: Add interface to the CAIRO graphics library.
- CVL: Always use 32bit for pixels.
- CVL: Replaced cvl_vector*_t types with simple pointers.
- CVL: Changed cvl_field_get*() functions. Added cvl_field_ref*() functions.
- CVL: cvl_io_read_pnm(), cvl_io_write_pnm(), cvl_io_load_pnm(),
       cvl_io_save_pnm()
  Reworked i/o functions to load/save and read/write pnm files.  
- CVL: cvl_dibr()
