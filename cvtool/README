Cvtool is a general-purpose computer vision tool.

It works as a filter: it reads streams of images from standard input and
writes manipulated images to standard output. It understands both the NetPBM
image formats (pbm, pgm, ppm, pam) and the YUV4MPEG2 raw video format used by
the mjpegtools. 

Cvtool integrates all its functionality into a single binary, and makes it
available through commands. For example, 
$ cvtool filter gauss --3d --k 3 < video.y4m > filtered-video.y4m
applies three-dimensional (spatiotemporal) Gauss smoothing to the video
video.y4m and writes the result to filtered-video.y4m. 

All the image manipulation and analysis functionality of cvtool is implemented
in CVL, a computer vision library. CVL is currently included in cvtool. It is
fully documented and can easily be used by other projects.

Cvtool is written in C99 and uses POSIX features where pure C99 is not
sufficient. The included CVL is written in pure C99. Therefore, portability is
not much of a problem. 

Cvtool depends on the following libraries:
- The GNU Scientific Library (GSL), version 1.6 or later, available from
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl
- The CAIRO graphics library, version 1.0.0 or later, available from
  http://www.cairographics.org/
