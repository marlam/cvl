CVL is a library for image and data processing using graphics processing units
(GPUs). 

It is suitable as a base for GPGPU applications (see http://www.gpgpu.org/).
CVL is based on OpenGL 2.1 and requires the GLEW library. It currently works
on GNU/Linux and Windows systems. 

CVL is bundled with cvtool, a command line tool that aims to make all of CVL's
functionality available as filters. It integrates well with other tools like
netpbm and pfstools.
