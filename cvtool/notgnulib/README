This library fulfills a similar purpose as gnulib: it provides portability
fixes for defective systems.

The modules in this library are written in a way that would make inclusion
into gnulib possible.

The reason that these modules are not part of gnulib is that they are
- not appropriate for gnulib, or
- not good enough for gnulib, or
- not complete, or
- specific to cvtool and not useful for others, or
- still in testing phase, or
- temporary hacks.

Where appropriate, modules of this library should be proposed for inclusion in
gnulib.
