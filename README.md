# CVL: image and data processing on GPUs

The CVL project consists of four components:
- libcvl, a library for GPU-based image and data processing. This uses OpenGL
  2.1 and requires the GLEW library.
- cvtool, a command line tool that aims to make all of the libcvl functionality
  available as filters. It integrates well with other tools like netpbm and
  pfstools.
- cvlview, a viewer for arbitrary 2D or 2D+depth data stored in PNM or PFS files.
- cvltonemap, an interactive tone mapping tool for high dynamic range images. 

**The CVL project is now inactive and obsolete; this source repository just serves as an archive.**
