Version 0.1.0:
- New and improved cvtool commands:
  - New subcommand "wallis" for the filter command.
- New and improved CVL functionality:
  - New functions cvl_filter_wallis() and cvl_filter3d_wallis().
  - New functions cvl_field_array() and cvl_field_const_array() to access the 
    raw array data of a field.
  - A new AM_LIBCVL macro, defined in cvl.m4. This depends on lib-link.m4 and
    config.rpath, but it is better than the old AM_PATH_CVL macro.
- Removed:
  - The cvl.pc pkg-config file and the cvl-config script used by the replaced
    AM_PATH_CVL macro. Use AM_LIBCVL instead.
- Miscellaneous:
  - Renamed "average" to "mean" where appropriate.
